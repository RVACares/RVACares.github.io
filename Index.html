            <dt><strong>How we came about!!!</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                <br /><br />
                There are many well known charity organizations in the United States. Most of them hire top notch employess to run them.
                As a result 50-95% of donations are used to run these companies rather than helping people. Thats where RVAcares comes in.
                It is a organization run by all the members of the RVA society.
                There are no CEO's or employees with extensive training. It is just people trying help people.<br /><br />

            <dt><strong>What we believe in!!!</strong> </dt>
            <dd>
                <br /><br />
                We believe in helping people, those who are struggling to make ends meet. RVA cares is a way to provide them support and atleast get some of mind.
                This website can help our veterans, our homeless, students, single parents etc <br /><br />
