    <p>RVA Cares has dozens of organizations that use our services to give back to the community.  We work with programs such as GoodWill, Salvation Army, Caritas, Local homeless shelters & Churches, and many more. These non-profit organizations use our services to stock their wide selection of apparel and miscellaneous items. We also get hundreds of daily individual users who browse our wide selection of items.  No matter your current situation, RVA Cares is the perfect donation program for you.</p>
